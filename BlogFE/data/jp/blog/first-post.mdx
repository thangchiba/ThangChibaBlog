# Welcome to My Personal Page!

Why have this blog?
Because at the end of a lifetime, what we have left is what we have given away.

I write numerous utility applications for my friends to use. This blog is where I share about the process, challenges, and real-world applications.

It would be very beneficial to document these experiences to ensure a longer retention of the knowledge gained.

I hope you find something useful here.
