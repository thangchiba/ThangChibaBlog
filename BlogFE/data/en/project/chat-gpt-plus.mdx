# ChatGPT++
ChatGPT is a web application that allows you to chat with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo AI model. The application can speak out loud response messages, learn new things, and save your conversations to your local machine. You can also use the same model with ChatGPT Plus for a very low cost. You can also share with your friends, and the OpenAI account offers $18 free to use as ChatGPT Plus for 3-6 months or more.

- Teachable AI: You can easy to teach the AI new things by providing it with examples of how to respond to certain inputs.
- Local data storage: Your conversations with the AI are stored locally on your machine using the browser's local storage API. No login is required to use this app.
- Responsive design : You can use both PC or Mobile. I will update for tablet after.

```
OPTIONS: If you want to set up a freetoken (user can use it for free when they enter "thangchiba" to access the token), you need to create a `.env` file on the same level as `package.json`. The content should be in this format:
Content will this format :
```
