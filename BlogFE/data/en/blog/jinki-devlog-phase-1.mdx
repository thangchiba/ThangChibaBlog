## **🛠️ Crafting the Foundation**

I have laid the groundwork with key features that define our gameplay:

- **Player vs Environment (PvE) Combat**: Engage in dynamic battles against AI-controlled opponents.
- **Movement Mechanics**: Experience fluid and responsive player movements.
- **Advanced Bot AI**: Encounter sophisticated AI that challenges and adapts to player strategies.
- **Enhanced Weaponry and Stats**: Equip diverse weapons and track player statistics for a comprehensive RPG experience.

These elements are vital for creating a gameplay environment that is not only engaging but also immersive and challenging.

## **🌟 A Vision for the Future**

Looking forward, my ambition is to evolve Jinki into a free-to-play mobile MMORPG designed to support a large and active player base. This game aims to connect players worldwide, creating a vast, shared universe that's both rich and immersive.
