**What’s New?**

- **Inventory System**: The new inventory system allows for item dragging, equipping, and usage. There are tooltips for items to help understand their attributes and uses. I crafted this feature using assets from indie mobile games, combined with custom scripts that I wrote to fit my unique requirements.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Enhancements to the GUI include a new HealthBar and Loading scenes, making the game more intuitive and visually engaging.
- **Pet Mechanics**: For now, pets will follow their owner around the game world. I have not yet implemented attack scripts for pets, but it’s on my roadmap!

**Development Notes**

As I gear up to tackle the networking aspect of Jinki, I anticipate rewriting about 70% of the current code to ensure scalability and performance. This means some features are still under development and will be polished in future updates.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to build and refine Jinki into the immersive PvE experience I envision it to be!
