**What’s New?**

- **Dialogue and Quests**: This update introduces a basic yet functional system for dialogues and quests. These features are designed to provide more structured gameplay and narrative direction, making the in-game world more engaging.
- **Advanced Bot Interaction**: To keep the bots interesting and less monotonous, I've implemented a version of ChatGPT-2 for dialogue interactions. This AI assistant can respond to player inquiries in any language. However, currently, the supported font languages are English, Japanese, and Vietnamese. For broader language support, I'm utilizing AWS Translate to bridge any gaps, ensuring that players from different backgrounds can enjoy the game in their preferred language.

**Development Notes**

While the quest and dialogue systems are still quite basic, my main focus for Jingi will eventually shift towards PvP features. This is where I plan to develop the most exciting and competitive aspects of the gameplay.

**Feedback Wanted**

I value your feedback immensely! If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the new features or future updates, please share them. Your input helps me improve the game and make it more enjoyable for everyone.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop Jingi into the rich and dynamic game world I envision!
