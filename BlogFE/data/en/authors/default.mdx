## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Thang Chiba

I'm a Software Engineer working at a company in Japan, where I dive deep into the world of programming and development.

My love for coding knows no bounds, and I find myself happily immersed in it all day long.

I thrive on pushing the boundaries of software and game development, challenging myself to tackle projects of increasing complexity. My ultimate ambition is to create my own Metaverse, a world crafted entirely by my imagination and technical skill. Through this blog, I aim to share the rich experiences and insights gained on my journey towards this goal.

I am a versatile Fullstack Web Developer with a keen interest in game development.

I work in the DX (Digital Transformation) department. My job involves implementing new technologies and digitizing processes to help clients achieve higher efficiency and revenues. Since integrating new technology into existing projects carries significant risks, I frequently experiment with new techniques that I have not tried before to improve my programming skills and potentially apply them to current projects if feasible.

I use a variety of programming languages and frameworks, and I am not afraid to learn something new if I feel it is necessary for the project.

## Why have this blog?

> Because at the end of a lifetime, what we have left is what we have given away.

I write numerous utility applications for my friends to use. This blog is where I share about the process, challenges, and real-world applications.

It would be very beneficial to document these experiences to ensure a longer retention of the knowledge gained.
