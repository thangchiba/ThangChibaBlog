## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Thang Chiba

I'm a Software Engineer working at a company in Japan, where I dive deep into the world of programming and development.

## About Me
I am someone who loves and is passionate about programming. ❤️

Instead of setting an alarm to wake up, I often set it to remind myself it’s time to go to bed.⏰

Today, I must surpass who I was yesterday. If I can’t run, I’ll walk; if I can’t walk, I’ll crawl however I must.

## My philosophy on software is as follows
・Good software allows users to operate it without needing a manual.

・Good code is such that colleagues can read it like an English essay, without needing comments.

・Any knowledge gained that is not applied, not demonstrated in a product, is merely theoretical.

・As an engineer primarily focused on backend processing, I still believe that UX/UI is extremely important, crucial to the success or failure of a product.

・Technology is secondary, the core is to serve users. No user cares which algorithm you use or how many days you spend optimizing. They only need their issues resolved with a smooth experience.

## My Career
Currently I'm Software development engineer working in the DX (Digital Transformation) department.
Experienced in building web applications from the ideation, design, development, deployment, and maintenance stages.
Always interested in emerging technologies, performance, and user experience.

Because my job is to apply digital technology to improve work efficiency by changing the way and processes of customers, I always try to learn and research the latest technologies to apply to my work.

However, applying new technology is not always effective, so I always consider and test before implementing it in products.
Therefore, I do a lot of personal projects to experiment with and research new technology before proposing it to the company.

I thrive on pushing the boundaries of software and game development, challenging myself to tackle projects of increasing complexity. My ultimate ambition is to create my own Metaverse, a world crafted entirely by my imagination and technical skill. Through this blog, I aim to share the rich experiences and insights gained on my journey towards this goal.

## Why have this blog?

> Because at the end of a lifetime, what we have left is what we have given away.

I write numerous utility applications for my friends to use. This blog is where I share about the process, challenges, and real-world applications.

It would be very beneficial to document these experiences to ensure a longer retention of the knowledge gained.
