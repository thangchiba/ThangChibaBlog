## Hoang Van Thang

Software Engineer - Tokyo, Japan

## Introduction
Software development engineer working in the DX (Digital Transformation) department.
Experienced in building web applications from the ideation, design, development, deployment, and maintenance stages.
Always interested in emerging technologies, performance, and user experience.

Because my job is to apply digital technology to improve work efficiency by changing the way and processes of customers, I always try to learn and research the latest technologies to apply to my work.
However, applying new technology is not always effective, so I always consider and test before implementing it in products.
Therefore, I do a lot of personal projects to experiment with and research new technology before proposing it to the company.

## Work Experience
_Tokyo, April 2022 - Now_

### **Project: Digitization of a B2B Wholesale Business Model.**

- Developed an order entry system that reduces manual operations and, most importantly, digitizes data. This digitization facilitates easier data analysis and historical data retrieval, enabling the business to expand its operations efficiently.

- The project is divided into several phases, each lasting from six months to a year.

- I was involved in every phase, from ideation and technology selection to system design, database, and codebase development.

- Implemented the Scrum model, setting up bi-weekly Sprints and reporting progress to the CEO.

- Tech stack: ReactJS/MUI, ReactNative, Swift, SpringBoot, PostgreSQL, AWS, OCR.

<Toggle text="Phase 1: April 2022 to March 2023">
    Kickstarted the project by analyzing client business processes.

    Produced documentation on business processes that could be digitized and estimated the impact of digital
    transformation.

    Created documents on tech stacks and libraries to be used, and designed comparison charts to justify selections.

    Developed an order system on the website to allow partners to place orders more simply and intuitively.

    Prices are updated in real time, and data is refreshed in the system, making retrieval easier.

    Tech stack: ReactJS, SpringBoot, PostgreSQL, AWS.

<Toggle text="Phase 2: April 2023 to December 2023">
    Researched the transformation of the client's old data entry system to a new one.

    The old data entry system used an MS-DOS interface with text commands, and data was overwritten each fiscal year,
    leaving it almost valueless for AI-driven big data analysis.

    Developed a new system:

    Invested in UI/UX: Introduced a GUI that could be navigated with a mouse, allowing for historical reviews and
    statistics. Included responsive design for executives to monitor from smartphones.

    In terms of UX, added Excel-like shortcut keys to increase productivity and reduce unnecessary operations.

    Focused on performance: Since itâ€™s a data entry application running on a web platform, performance was a priority.
    Employed techniques and strategies to optimize the performance of React.

    Tech stack: ReactJS, SpringBoot, PostgreSQL, AWS.

<Toggle text="Phase 3: January 2024 to Present">
    "Paper Less"

    Digitized procurement and sales invoices. Current invoices are handwritten and entered into the computer system at
    the end of the day.

    Instead of writing on paper, staff use a stylus on tablets, with characters digitized in real-time and saved to the
    Database, eliminating the need for manual data entry and paper.

    Tech stack: ReactNative - Swift, AI Handwriting Recognition(Keras/Tensorflow).

## **Personal Projects**

- [NeoSocket](/project/neo-socket): A high-performance framework for real-time applications, designed for developing MMORPG games and Metaverse, as well as for chat systems and dashboard management. Efficiently uses resources to handle up to 400k requests with just 1 CPU core on GCP. Developed from the need for a more powerful solution than existing open-source frameworks, with the principle of writing clean code like web development but with gaming-level performance.

- [ChatGPT++](/project/chat-gpt-plus): A chat interface for everyone to use OpenAI's API. Provides an experience equivalent to buying a premium package but at a much lower cost.

- [Cypher](/project/cypher): Inspired by World War II. An anonymous chat application using NeoSocket for end-to-end encryption. Users can start chat sessions without logging in or authentication, while still ensuring security.

- [Apartment Management](/project/apartment-management): A SaaS application used to manage rental properties. The application manages rented rooms, tenant information, and payment status. Due to infrequent access, the goal is to use AWS Serverless to optimize operating costs. For example, S3 for static web hosting, Cognito for authentication, and Lambda Functions for backend processing.

- [Jingi](/project/jingi): An MMORPG game that combines Diablo's inventory and quest systems with the complex combat mechanics of League of Legends. Uses NeoSocket to build a complex open world while ensuring performance and player experience.

- [NeoSekai](/project/neo-sekai): My first Metaverse MVP product, introducing breakthrough server optimization improvements. By combining data packets and dynamic load balancing, NeoSekai can create vast virtual worlds cost-effectively with the capacity to host thousands of simultaneous users.
