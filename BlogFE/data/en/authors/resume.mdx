## Hoang Van Thang
Software Engineer - Tokyo, Japan

---

## Introduction
Software development engineer working in the DX (Digital Transformation) department.
Experienced in building web applications from the ideation, design, development, deployment, and maintenance stages.
Always interested in emerging technologies, performance, and user experience.

Because my job is to apply digital technology to improve work efficiency by changing the way and processes of customers, I always try to learn and research the latest technologies to apply to my work.
However, applying new technology is not always effective, so I always consider and test before implementing it in products.
Therefore, I do a lot of personal projects to experiment with and research new technology before proposing it to the company.
